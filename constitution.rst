PART B – OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
Origins
3 The Australian Labor Party had its origins in:
(a) the aspirations of the Australian people for a decent, secure, dignified and constructive way of life;
(b) the recognition by the trade union movement of the necessity for a political voice to take forward the struggle of the working class against the excesses, injustices and inequalities of capitalism; and
(c) the commitment by the Australian people to the creation of an independent, free and enlightened Australia.
Objectives
4 The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields.
5 To achieve the political and social values of equality, democracy, liberty and social co- operation inherent in this objective, the Australian Labor Party stands for:
(a) redistribution of political and economic power so that all members of society have the opportunity to participate in the shaping and control of the institutions and relationships which determine their lives;
(b) establishment and development of public enterprises, based upon federal, state and other forms of social ownership, in appropriate sectors of the economy;
(c) democratic control and strategic social ownership of Australian natural resources for the benefit of all Australians;
(d) maintenance of and support for a competitive non-monopolistic private sector, including small business and farming, controlled and owned by Australians, operating within clear social guidelines and objectives;
(e) the right to own private property;
(f) recognition and encouragement of the right of labour to organise for the protection and advancement of its interests;
(g) the application of democracy in industry to increase the opportunities for people to work in satisfying, healthy and humane conditions; and to participate in and to increase their control over the decision making processes affecting them;
(h) the promotion of socially appropriate technology and the monitoring of its introduction to ensure that the needs and interests of labour, as well as the requirements of competitive industry and consumer demand, are taken into consideration;
(i) the restoration and maintenance of full employment;
(j) the abolition of poverty, and the achievement of greater equality in the distribution of income, wealth and opportunity;

(l) equal access and rights to employment, education, information, technology, housing, health and welfare services, cultural and leisure activities and the law;
(m) reform of the Australian Constitution and other political institutions to ensure that they reflect the will of the majority of Australian citizens and the existence of Australia as an independent republic;
(n) recognition and protection of fundamental political and civil rights, including freedom of expression, the press, assembly, association, conscience and religion; the right to privacy; the protection of the individual from oppression by the state; and democratic reform of the Australian legal system;
(o) the development of a democratic communications system, as an integral part of a free society, to which all citizens have opportunities for free access;
(p) elimination of discrimination and exploitation on the grounds of class, race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, religion, political affiliation, national origin, citizenship, age, disability, regional location, economic or household status;
(q) recognition of the prior ownership of Australian land by Aborigines and Islanders; recognition of their special and essential relationship with the land as the basis of their culture; and a commitment to the return of established traditional lands to the ownership of Aboriginal and Islander communities;
(r) recognition and encouragement of diversity of cultural expression and lifestyle within the Australian community;
(s) the use, conservation and enhancement of Australia’s natural resources and environment so that the community’s total quality of life, both now and into the future, is maintained and improved;
(t) recognition of the need to work towards achieving ecologically sustainable development;
(u) maintenance of world peace; an independent Australian position in world affairs; the recognition of the right of all nations to self determination and independence; regional and international agreement for arms control and disarmament; the provision of economic and social aid to developing nations; a commitment to resolve international conflicts through the UN; and a recognition of the inalienable right of all people to liberty, equality, democracy and social justice; and
(v) recognition of the right of citizens to work for progressive changes consistent with the broad principles of democratic socialism.
Principles of action
6 The Australian Labor Party believes that the task of building democratic socialism is a co-operative process that requires:
(a) constitutional action through the federal and state parliaments, municipal and other statutory authorities,
5
adopted 18 December 2018

(b) union action, and
(c) ongoing action by organised community groups.
Membership and organisation
7 Membership of the Australian Labor Party is open to all residents of Australia who are prepared to accept its objectives and who have associations with no other political party.
8 Australian Labor Party policy is made by National Conferences comprising the federal and state parliamentary leadership of the Party, together with elected delegates from all states and Australian Young Labor.
9 Party policy within the states is framed by conferences of delegates elected by constituent branches, affiliated unions and members. Policy within the Australian Labor Party is not made by directives from the leadership, but by resolutions originating from branches, affiliated unions and individual Party members.

The Administrative Committee must declare the winnable seats for each preselection before nominations for preselection open.
(iii) All other seats to be preselected. (The seats in the Federal Parliament lower house and upper house must be grouped together.)
13
adopted 18 December 2018

(f) For casual vacancies in the Senate and the House of Representatives, if less than the minimum percentage of the remaining positions are held by women, the vacancy must be filled by a woman.
(g) If at the close of nominations for a preselection for a group of seats or positions the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) cannot not be met, nominations for that group of seats or positions must be reopened.
(h) If after a ballot for a preselection for a group of seats or positions the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) are not met, nominations for that group of seats or positions must be reopened and a fresh ballot (if necessary) conducted.
(i) In calculating the minimum percentage for the purposes of this clause, a fraction of more than one-half must be rounded up to the next whole number, and a fraction of one-half or less must be rounded down to the next whole number.
(j) Each state branch is encouraged to implement these clauses in their rules, and following such action, submit to the National Executive for approval immediately after the next state conference of the state branch following the 2015 National Conference.

Election of delegates to National Conference
32 (a) State branch delegates to National Conference (including proxy delegates) must be elected in accordance with the rules of that state branch, subject to clause 15.
22
adopted 18 December 2018

(b) The delegates from each state must include:
(i) a number of delegates directly elected by the financial members of the state branch that is at least equal to the number of House of Representative electorates in that state as at the previous 31 December; and
(ii) delegates from outside metropolitan areas.
Composition of state conferences
33 In all states the state conference shall comprise 50 per cent union representatives and 50 per cent constituency Party representatives. (This shall not bind territory branches until the proportion of unions affiliated is equivalent to that in the states. This principle shall apply to all state level Party units comprising direct representatives of unions and constituency units.)
Membership
34 (a)
(b) (c)
Membership of the ALP is open to all residents of Australia who are prepared to accept its objectives and who have associations with no other political party or proscribed organisation. This right to join shall not be impaired other than in circumstances in which it can be demonstrated clearly that an individual cannot meet the requirement outlined above.
Members of the Party are encouraged to be members of a union or to employ union labour. However, state branch rules must not require members of the Party to be members of a union or to employ union labour.
To further encourage union members to join the Party, state branches should offer discounts in membership subscriptions for members of affiliated unions.
Membership recruitment
35 (a)
It is an abuse of Party rules for an individual or group/s to fund Party membership for other individuals or groups of individuals who would otherwise be unwilling to pay their own subscriptions.
(b) It is an abuse of Party rules for an individual or group/s to encourage reduced-rate membership to people that may not be eligible for that category of membership.
(c) It is an abuse of Party rules for an individual or group/s to recruit members who do not live at the claimed addresses in an attempt to gain advantage at local Party meetings or the outcome of Party ballots.
(d) It is a requirement of Party rules that members either correctly enrol with the Australian Electoral Commission to vote in a federal election at their stated address, or not be eligible to do so because they are under 18 years of age or not an Australian citizen. If members are enrolled to vote, and they join a branch, sub- branch or other party body that has specific geographic coverage under state branch rules, they must do so using the address at which they are enrolled to vote.
(e) Applicants must personally apply for membership by:
(i) signing their own membership application and organising to post the form back to the state branch office with the membership fee;
23
adopted 18 December 2018

(ii) signing their own membership application and personally attending the state branch office to submit the application and pay the membership fee;
(iii) if their state branch rules currently permit, signing their own membership application and arranging a person to attend the state branch office on their behalf to submit the application and their membership fee (identification is necessary);
(iv) completing an application form online and paying their membership fee by electronic funds transfer from their personal account, or with their personal credit card; or
(v) if their state branch rules permit, personally attending their local branch meeting and paying their membership fee to the Secretary during the meeting. The money must be receipted to the member and the member’s attendance recorded in any attendance book. The Secretary must forward the money to the state branch office along with the signed application form.
(f) Members must personally renew their membership by:
(i) any of the means in paragraph (e);
(ii) by phone using their personal credit card; or
(iii) by signing a standing authority for the renewal of their membership and payment of their membership fees by electronic funds transfer from their personal account, or with their personal credit card.
(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (f), a person’s membership may also be renewed by a family member resident in the same household.
(h) Members who apply for membership by completing an application form online must not receive voting rights in any election unless:
(i) they vote in person, with proof of address and photo ID;
(ii) they comply with the maximum possible relevant state eligibility requirement for “length of membership”, in order to give effect to the principle that no member who applies online may receive voting rights for any election in a shorter period than any member who applies through a local branch; or
(iii) they comply with the relevant state eligibility requirement for “branch attendance” if the election is for Party Conference delegates or candidates for public office.
(i) In order to prevent the “bulk renewal” of other members, the National Executive must prescribe membership application and renewal forms for use by all state branches that:
(i) require the signature of the applicant or member authorising the application or renewal; and
(ii) contain a declaration by any applicant or member paying a reduced-rate subscription that they are entitled to that reduced rate. The declaration must also indicate the basis on which the member is claiming this entitlement. State branches may also set standard requirements of evidence to be met by members claiming this entitlement.
24
adopted 18 December 2018

(j) All state branches must implement an appropriate cap or limitation/review procedure relating to the number of members that may validly apply to join the ALP at a local branch or sub- branch meeting. Members who seek to transfer into a branch or sub-branch shall be included/counted for the purposes of determining the number of members to which the cap or limitation applies.
(k) Involvement in such abuses will be considered as behaviour likely to bring the Party into disrepute and will result in disciplinary action which may include expulsion under the rules of the Party.
(l) All state branch rules must, where necessary, establish a tribunal to effectively resolve disputes concerning membership. All state dispute tribunals will operate according to due process and according to the national membership principles and rules.
(m) All state branch rules must contain a procedure that permits a decision to admit a person as a Party member to be reviewed, where there is an allegation that the person was ineligible to become a Party member.
(n) All state branch rules must permit 50 members or 25 per cent of the members in a federal electorate, whichever is the lesser, to petition the Administrative Committee or state Executive to investigate any allegations of breaches of this rule in that electorate.
(o) In order to ensure that this clause is given effect, the state branches of ALP be required to amend, where necessary, their rules to reflect this clause. Such amended rules will be presented to the National Executive no later than 1 November 2003.
(p) The National Executive must continue:
(i) to monitor and enforce compliance with this clause; and
(ii) to review the operation of this clause to ensure the integrity of the Party’s membership processes.
(q) All states branches must provide to the National Executive a complete current branch membership list by no later than 31 July of each year.
Members’ rights
36 The following are to be established as minimum standards:
(a) The process of joining the Party shall be simplified and all unnecessary impediments to that process shall be removed from state branch rules.
(b) Subject to any attendance requirements in the state or territory, full membership rights in all states and territories shall begin to accrue in accordance with the relevant state requirements and those rights shall accumulate, to a maximum, following two years consecutive membership. These rights include: being eligible for preselection; standing and voting for or standing on, the various Party bodies and executives.
25
adopted 18 December 2018

(c) Each state branch must adopt rules that establish an appeals process in relation to compliance with and enforcement of branch rules by members, affiliated unions and constituent units of the branch, such rules to be submitted to the National Executive for approval by 1 November 2003. The appeals process must include compliance with the rules of procedural fairness, expedited hearings and written reasons for decision.
Affiliation of unions
37 (a)
All bona fide unions shall have the right to affiliate to the ALP. This right to affiliate shall not be impaired unless it can be demonstrated clearly that the relevant organisation is not a bona fide union or that the organisation has engaged in conduct that renders it unsuitable to be affiliated.
(b) For the purposes of calculating union delegation sizes and affiliation fees, the number of members of each affiliated union must be determined each year by an independent audit by a registered auditor of:
(i) the number of members eligible to vote in a ballot for an office in that union at 30 June as conducted by the appropriate Electoral Commission/s, and
(ii) the number of members identified in subparagraph (i) for whom the union received an amount of dues in relation to the period between 1 April and 30 June inclusive for that year.
(c) Each affiliated union must by 4.00 pm on the last Friday in February each year provide to the state branch in a sealed envelope:
(i) the independent audit report for the previous year, and
(ii) advice on the number of members that union will affiliate on for the current year,
and all such sealed envelopes must be opened at the same time in the presence of scrutineers appointed by affiliated unions.
(d) Union delegation sizes must be based on the three year rolling average of that union’s affiliation for the current and two preceding years (except that affiliation figures before 2002 must not be used to determine a union’s rolling average).
(e) Each state branch (other than the Queensland Branch) must amend its rules to implement paragraphs (b)–(d) in accordance with the model adopted by the National Executive for the Queensland Branch on 12 April 2002.
Union delegations
38 Subject to clause 19(c), it shall be the right of each union to determine the criteria and procedures for selection of its delegates, subject to those delegates being financial members of that union and of the Party.
26
adopted 18 December 2018

State Labor Advisory Councils
39 (a)
(b) (c)
In each state there will be a Labor Advisory Council (LAC), consisting of the Leader and senior members of the state Parliamentary Labor Party (SPLP), the state President and Secretary or their nominees, and representatives of the Trades and Labour Council or equivalent body in that state.
The role of the LAC will be to provide a formal consultative mechanism between the Party and the union movement in that state.
The LAC will include a Campaigns and Growth Forum based on the ACTU model, to connect affiliated unions, the Party and the SPLP into a more meaningful dialogue on shared challenges.
Preselections
40 (a) (b)
(c)
Any member who meets the membership eligibility requirements shall be entitled to participate in voting for a candidate in any preselection covered by the applicable boundaries within which they reside, subject to paragraph (c).
The only residential boundaries that can affect that right are those devised by either federal, state or municipal electoral commissions. That is, the entitlement is guaranteed by the publicly known and independently drawn boundaries of respective electoral commissions. Therefore, if you live within the respective electorate and meet other criteria within the rules you are eligible to vote in the preselection.
To ensure the integrity of preselection ballots, no member shall receive a vote in any preselection unless that member is correctly enrolled with the Australian Electoral Commission to vote in a federal election. The member’s address for the purposes of preselection will be their enrolled address.
Community preselections

Electors who wish to vote in a community preselection ballot must first sign a declaration stating that they are:
(i) a Labor supporter, and
(ii) not a member of another political party or one of its affiliated organisations.
Clause 19 applies to community preselections in the same way as other public office preselections.

PART E – REGISTER OF CONFERENCE DECISIONS
Members initiating legal proceedings (decision of the 1955 Conference)
48 This Conference resolves that as a general principle it cannot concede the right of any member of the Party to initiate legal proceedings for the purpose of establishing the constitutional behaviour of the Labor Movement. We emphasise that, with a few isolated exceptions, the history of our Party discloses we have functioned on a basis of complete determination in accordance with our own rules and our own interpretation of them. We insist we must continue to create our own procedures, taking care of our own business without the introduction of lawyers and law courts.
28
adopted 18 December 2018

Union elections (decision of the 1963 Conference)
49 Conference believes that industrial legislation should provide for trade unions to properly determine their own internal policies in accordance with their rules and constitutions and deplores interference in trade unions activities by any government, outside individuals or organisations. Conference accordingly calls upon all trade unionists to refrain from interference in the internal affairs of another trade union.
Grievance procedures (decision of the 1979 Conference)
50 Conference believes that the procedures of the Party at state and national level provide adequate opportunity for people who are dissatisfied to seek redress of grievance and calls upon all members of the Party in respect of matters in dispute to refrain from making comment outside the Party.
Affirmative action (decision of the 1981 Conference)
51 (a)
That all Party publications and Party ballot papers be given an indication of sex by use of given names.
(b) That it be the policy of the ALP to investigate, instigate, and fund the provision of childcare facilities at all conferences and large assembly meetings of the Party.
(c) That it be the policy of the ALP that all Party literature and publications should be free of sexist terms and sexist overtones; similarly all Party conferences, meetings etc. should be free of sexist comments, terms and overtones of any kind and all officers, MPs and members of the Party should be advised accordingly.
(d) (i)
Conference notes the enormous progress that has been made since 2002 towards achieving the targets in clause 19.
(ii) Conference is of the view that the final attainment of the targets in clause 19 needs to be balanced with the desirability of not interfering in the preselection of sitting MPs.
(iii) Conference recognises this is a complex issue, which requires detailed consideration by both the National Executive and the National Labor Women’s Network.
(iv) Accordingly, Conference directs the National Executive and the NLWN Executive to establish a joint working group to report back to National Conference on the most appropriate mechanism for implementing the view Conference has expressed in subparagraph (ii).
Abortion (decision of the 1984 Conference)
52 Conference resolves that the matter of abortion can be freely debated at any state or federal forum of the Australian Labor Party, but any decision reached is not binding on any member of the Party.
29
adopted 18 December 2018

Conduct of ballots (decision of the 1994 Conference)

ALP Code of Conduct for Fundraising (decision of the 2018 Conference)
54 Preamble
Australia’s political, economic, and social stability is dependent on the strength of our
democratic system.
The Australian Labor Party (ALP) seeks to ensure every Australian is fairly represented in democratic processes and systems; regardless of wealth, education, background, or status.
In striving to achieve this aim, the ALP believes in an independent, well-resourced, transparent, and fair electoral process that is protected from vested interests, both at home and abroad.
The ALP believes that our democracy is strengthened by the ability of the public, including Australian unions and business, to make moderate and transparent financial contributions to further democratic debate, or to support a particular candidate for election. The ALP has a long-standing commitment to moderate and fair public funding of political systems, including political parties.
a. The following code of conduct establishes the conditions that govern fundraising by the ALP at state and national levels.
b. This code is binding on all ALP branches, other constituent units, Parliamentarians and candidates for public office.
c. Funds are raised by the organisational wing of the ALP primarily to assist candidates for public office to gain and/or maintain office.
d. Funds are needed for policy development, Party administration and, most importantly, campaigning. All these political tasks must be carried out federally and in each state.
e. The National Secretary and each State Secretary of the ALP has a responsibility to raise funds to support these functions.
f. Campaign and public responsibilities can overshadow the need for adequate funds to support a strong and effective Party organisation. Lack of funding for Party maintenance and administration not only drains the Party’s ability to develop policy and maintain membership, but also undermines Labor’s ability to campaign effectively and give a genuine choice to the Australian community in elections.
30
adopted 18 December 2018

1. Organisation of fundraising
a. The National Secretary has ultimate responsibility for fundraising at the national level.
State Secretaries have the primary responsibility for fundraising at a state level.
b. The National Secretariat and each state branch raise funds co-operatively but separately.
c. Each branch organises its fundraising efforts independently and according to its own methods, subject to the conditions outlined in this code.
d. The National Secretariat collects funds for national campaigning, administrative support of the Party and the support of various state branches. These funds support the National Secretariat’s role of national policy development, assistance to the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and maintenance of the Party’s professional and voluntary organisation throughout Australia.
e. State and national offices shall operate systems of centralised bank accounts to ensure the efficient and secure expenditure of ALP finances and assist the party to meet its commitment to transparency.
f. All local campaign and other party accounts will be held under the relevant state central banking system with the relevant Tax File Number. Central bank accounts may be held at a national level where it is appropriate to do so.
g. It is the legitimate responsibility of the relevant State or National Secretary, finance committee members and/or collectors to accept money on behalf of the ALP.
h. ALP staff, Parliamentarians and candidates for public office may act as fundraising agents for the ALP and in that capacity receive funds on behalf of the ALP.
i. The National Secretary has the ultimate responsibility for the maintenance and enforcement of the provisions in this code.
2. Conditions of this Code
a. The ALP and its constituent units observe the following fundraising code of conduct. This code is fundamental to the integrity of the ALP and its organisational and Parliamentary members.
b. Parliamentarians and candidates, acknowledging the collective party effort to secure their election as representatives of the ALP, can and should voice the party’s need for both support and funds. This may include appeal emails and correspondence, together with regular appearances at ALP fundraising events.
c. All funds raised for, by, or in the name of the ALP, must comply with the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, and any other relevant legislation or associated regulation. Any funds raised by constituent units of the party, including state branches, must comply with any relevant state legislation.
31
adopted 18 December 2018

d. Donations raised or accepted as part of any ALP fundraising effort must be held in a central banking account, which the National Secretariat or relevant state branch has visibility of and control over. It must, in its name, indicate that it is an ALP account. No funds raised by, for or in the name of the ALP may be held in personal accounts.
e. Any funds held in other accounts, or otherwise not under an ALP central banking system with the relevant Tax File Number, will be regarded by the ALP and any other interested party as “personal accounts”.
f. Cheques, direct online donations and direct financial transfers (for example through online banking) should be made payable to a central, ALP-named account, not individuals.
g. Any intermediary accounts set up on a digital platforms (e.g. paypal) for the purpose of fundraising must be directly linked to a central, ALP-named account. All outflows from these intermediary accounts should be restricted to a central, ALP-named account.
h. The detail of donations shall be publicly disclosed as per the requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
i. Parliamentarians should never use the resources of public office to assist in their own or the ALP’s fundraising efforts.
j. The ALP at a national level, and all federal Parliamentarians and candidates for public office, will not accept donations from foreign sources. Funds raised for, by, or in the name of the federal ALP or federal Parliamentarians or candidates for public office must be obtained from a verified domestic source. This includes, without limitation, funds obtained from individuals, corporate entities, unincorporated associations or any other type of entity. For the purpose of enforcing this clause, the National Executive will from time-to-time establish guidelines to help Party agents determine the origins of donations so as to ensure that only donations from domestic sources are received.
k. Without limiting the conditions imposed on the federal ALP and federal Parliamentarians and candidates for public office by the preceding paragraph, where possible, all ALP fundraising agents should seek reasonable assurance that funds raised have no connection to foreign or prohibited sources.
l. All fundraising bodies, including ALP fundraising agents, should give due consideration to the possible perception of any individual donation and whether it may reflect negatively on the party as a whole.
m. The ALP does not accept funds that are subject to conditions of any kind, whether they be explicit or implied.
n. Under no circumstances will the ALP accept funds which, even if only by inference, are intended to obtain the Party’s support for specific actions, attitudes or public statements.
32
adopted 18 December 2018

o. Donors retain a right to put forward views to the Party or individual Parliamentarians, however this right does not exceed that of any other general member of the Party or Australian enrolled voter or citizen.
p. The ALP and its constituent units never raise funds on behalf of any other party or organisation.
q. Under no circumstances will the ALP, its Parliamentarians, or any of its endorsed candidates for public office accept donations from the tobacco industry.
