# Progress Party
How could a 21st Century progressive political party work, using the Australian
Labor Party (ALP) Constitution as a starting point?

### Road Map

1. I've included the current ALP Constitution downloaded on Sunday 14 April 2019 at 20:30pm
from https://www.alp.org.au/media/1574/alp_national_constitution.pdf as `constitution.rst`.

2. Format this into Restructured Text (better than Markdown for complex documents) to make it 
readable/exportable.

3. Write `requirements.rst`, explaining perceived problems, requirements of the new party, and outline
approach to delivering requirements.

4. Start making changes to constitution that may address requirements, update requirements, regular
commits with good explanations to allow others to follow and trace changes from original ALP
Constitution.

5. Iterate and work with other contributors to make this and/or forks better.

6. Use as a basis for building applications and services to run the party described.
